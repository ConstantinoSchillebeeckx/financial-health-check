If your employer does not match 401(k) contributions, enter 0.<br>Some employers will match a portion of your contributions. For example, an employer might match 50% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary. In that case, you would need to contribute 5% of your salary to get the full benefit of the match (even though the match equals 2.5% of your salary), and you should still enter 5 in this box.",
